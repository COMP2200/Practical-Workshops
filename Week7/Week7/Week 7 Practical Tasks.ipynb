    "The Pokemon dataset that we used in Week 4 is a good example to use for clustering as it has a number of numerical fields giving the properties of each Pokemon.  We can also imagine that there might be different types of Pokemon within the data, so using clustering methods to find the different types is a reasonable approach.  \n",
